// ES6 - Module
// There are two types of exports: Named and Default.

// Named Exports,
// You can create named exports two ways:
// In-line individually:
export const name = "Tobias";
export const age = 18
// All at once at the bottom:
const name2 = "Tobias";
const age2 = 18
export { name2, age2 }
